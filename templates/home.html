            <h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2>
            <p>Emotional regulation is a challenge for many people, and the usual routes—therapy, medication, or even self-help—can be costly or difficult to access.

Chromotherapy isn’t just a product; it’s a step toward making emotional wellness available to everyone.</p>
